Welcome to **Windows Journey!** This course is an attempt at compiling all the different aspects of Windows system administration and hardening into a concise resource for beginners to learn.

My experience with cybersecurity mainly comes from participating in [CyberPatriot](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org) and [CCDC](https://nccdc.org). For students new to these competitions, or cybersecurity in general, this resource is for you.
