## Windows Versions

You're probably familiar with how Windows has "generations" of operating systems (for example XP, 7, 8, 10, and now 11). What isn't discussed as much is how each generation gets different "versions" of Windows, each tailored to different use cases.

The major versions of Windows are:
* **Home**: The most "basic" version of Windows that gets put on consumer computers. If you bought a computer that came with Windows, it's most likely this. It has basic security features, but doesn't have a lot of the features we'll be exploring.
* **Pro**: A business-oriented version of Home that comes with extra features at an extra cost. It enables support for centralized management and more advanced security features that are generally not needed for consumer use. Other versions of Windows that fall under the umbrella of Pro include Windows Education and Windows Enterprise; the only difference is that these versions are sold in large batches to entire organizations, not individually.
* **Server**: A version of Windows dedicated to running server software and features. Instead of day-to-day use, computers running Windows Server will host websites, file shares, or even centralize management of other Windows computers. Updates tend to be released less often, because reliability (trying not to break a working system) is prioritized over running the newest software.

Windows Server versions are numbered based on the year, not the source OS, so this is a quick reference for which Windows version matches the Server version.

| Windows Version | Windows Server Version                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| XP              | Server 2003                               |
| Vista           | Server 2008                               |
| 7               | Server 2008 R2                            |
| 8               | Server 2012                               |
| 8.1             | Server 2012 R2                            |
| 10              | Server 2016<br>Server 2019<br>Server 2022 |
| 11              | Server 2025                               |

An important thing to keep in mind about Microsoft's philosophy towards Windows is that newer versions of Windows **must** be compatible with software that ran on older versions of Windows. 

You are given the power to *deliberately downgrade* your security to maintain compatibility, so keep that in mind when you see settings that seem illogical to have.
