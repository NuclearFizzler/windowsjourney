## Windows Virtual Machines

If you want to experiment with doing the things we'll be describing in this course, it's best to have a virtual machine (VM, computer running inside your computer) to mess around with instead of messing with your own computer. Windows Home also does not include some of the features we'll be exploring, so it's best to use something like Windows Server to try these things out.

Windows isn't free if you want to use it permanently, but you can download "Evaluation Images" for temporary use. These images work for a 180-day interval, and can be "rearmed" to restart the timer up to 6 times.  

The images can be downloaded through Microsoft's [Evaluation Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter). If you want to find older operating systems, Googling "Windows Server (version) evaluation image" will point you to Microsoft's download page for that image. If the version Microsoft provides is too new for any reason, you can try the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/search?query=Windows+ISO).

On the page, you will be prompted to download a `.iso` file. These files can be loaded into software like VMWare, VirtualBox, or Proxmox to install that operating system on a VM.
