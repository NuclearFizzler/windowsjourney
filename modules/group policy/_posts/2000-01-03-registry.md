## The Windows Registry

Technically, Group Policy is a "frontend" for the Windows Registry, where the actual binary data for the security settings are stored and read from. It also stores some application settings and info.

Access: "Registry Editor" or `regedit.msc`

There might be settings that need to be set through there. A entry in the Windows Registry, or "key," is addressed similarly to a file path.
