## Windows Firewall

(under construction)

Turn it on/off in simple settings, but the actual rules are in Advanced Windows Firewall
* Allow access to a port
* Allow access to a program

Usually, default is all outbound ALLOW and inbound is default DENY (Is this a Linux-ism?) 
* EX: Firewall exemptions for Chrome/Firefox/web browsers created when you install them; is it a default ALLOW behavior or is it just because the rules are autogenerated?
