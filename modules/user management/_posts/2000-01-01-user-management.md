## User Management

There are 3 ways to do this:
1) Control Panel
2) Computer Management
3) Windows command line

### General Guide for Recognizing "Good/Bad" Users
If you have a list of users (CyberPatriot):
* Use them

If you don't (CCDC):

### Control Panel
Start > Add or Remove Users (depends on Windows version but you'll know it)

Start Menu > Computer Management OR Run > compmgmt.msc

Local Users and Groups > Users > Manage from there

### Command Line
**Command Prompt:**
`net user ()`

**PowerShell:**
