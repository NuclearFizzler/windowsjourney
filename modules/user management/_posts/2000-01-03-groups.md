## Groups

compmgmt.msc > Local Users and Groups > Groups

Important Groups to note:
* Administrators: your admins (duh)
* Users
* Remote Desktop Users: Allowed to log into the computer over RDP
* Remote Management Users: Allowed to access the system with WinRM
* Backup Operators: Have the privilege to override security restrictions to back up files (Read: Dump the Password Database)

Note that the description does not equal automatic privilege!
* EX: Add user to Remote Desktop Users, but if that group hasn't been granted "Allow Log On Remotely" privilege in Group Policy, you still can't RDP in
